# Eval Run Report Format

The comment-ready markdown one eval run posts to its iteration PR — the **transcript-integrated**
format (iteration-6, #1725). The graded-check mechanics live **inside** the transcript, in causal
order (contract → thinking → action → verdict-on-action), so a reader follows the run as it
happened instead of hunting a separate table. This is the format contract: what every run comment
carries, section by section, so the renderer (`report.py`), the assembler (`assemble.py`), the
extractor (`conftest.py`), and a human reading the PR all share one shape.

Read this alongside:

- **`docs/agent-task-workflow.md` §4** — the *protocol* (a PR is live from the first run; every run
  posts its report as a **new** comment). This document is the *format* those comments take.
- **`penny/tests/eval/report.py`** — the pure renderer of the grammar below (the row types, the
  per-step tables, the banner, folding). Hand-built inputs render identically to extracted ones.
- **`penny/tests/eval/conftest.py`** (`_write_sample_report` + the `_build_transcript` extraction) —
  turns a sample's persisted promptlog into the `report.py` model.
- **`penny/tests/eval/assemble.py`** — composes the run header + per-sample blocks + footer.

## The one rule: the PR comment IS the record; the bulk stays local

A run comment carries the **whole evaluation** — the verdict, every step, the thinking at every
model action — because the comment *is* the durable, inspectable record of the iteration (read as
GitHub markdown, in the PR's comment stream). The heavy raw artifacts never enter the comment and
are **never committed** (see [What gets committed](#what-gets-committed)).

## Posting a run: the one-shot + the unreviewed-run banner (#1757)

Posting a run's report is a **one-shot** — `make eval-report`, not a hand-assembled `make assemble`
piped into `gh` — and the debt of *not* posting is made **structural** (the root
*structural-state-over-model-judgment* principle, applied to the eval loop itself). The joint-checkpoint
rule — run an eval, POST its report to the PR, then STOP for joint review before the next run — used to
be prose-only: posting was a manual step separate from running, so skipping it left no visible debt and
nothing interrupted the next run (a real violation ran 4+ sequential report-runs without posting a single
report). Two mechanisms close that gap:

- **`make eval-report PR=<n> [RUN=<run-dir-name>] [FORCE=1]`** assembles a completed run and posts the
  assembled markdown **verbatim** as a comment on PR `<n>`, then stamps a `.posted` **marker** into the
  run dir holding the posted comment's URL. `RUN` names a run dir under the durable artifact home
  (#1734); omitted, it defaults to the **most-recent completed run** (the newest dir holding a
  `manifest.json`). The assemble output is captured cleanly by invoking the containerized
  `python -m penny.tests.eval.assemble` directly (never `make assemble` piped through stripping), and the
  token is minted inside the recipe (`GH_TOKEN=$(make token) gh pr comment …`). It **fails loudly** — never
  a silent no-op — when `PR` is unset, the run dir is missing, the token is empty, or the assembled output
  is empty. It is **idempotent by the marker**: a run already carrying `.posted` re-posts **only** with
  `FORCE=1`; otherwise it prints the existing comment URL and exits 0.

- **The unreviewed-run banner** rides `make eval`: before it takes a GPU queue ticket, it scans the durable
  home for run dirs that hold a `manifest.json` but **no** `.posted` — the *unreviewed* set — and prints a
  loud, multi-line banner naming each one (`⚠ N unreviewed eval run(s) … → post each: make eval-report
  PR=<n> …`), visible in the session transcript where it can't be un-seen. It **warns, never blocks**: an
  intentional multi-run sweep stays possible; the debt is just undeniable.

**Marker semantics.** A run dir with a `manifest.json` is a **completed run**; a run dir also carrying a
`.posted` marker is a **posted (reviewed) run**. A **lever-less ephemeral run writes no `manifest.json`**
(#1734), so it is never a run dir here and never appears in the banner — by design: those runs leave no
artifacts to review. The marker file's content is the posted comment's URL (read back by the idempotency
branch). The Makefile checks the marker host-side; the scan/latest logic lives in the pure, plain-tested
`penny/tests/eval/checkpoint.py` (`run_dirs` / `latest_run_dir` / `unreviewed_runs` / `render_banner`),
invoked in-container by the recipes so it reads the mounted home.

## Row grammar (one fixed form per row type)

Every per-step table uses these rows, identically everywhere:

| row type | column-1 label | body (column 2) | score cell (column 3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **step header** | `step N · 👤` | `"user message"` | the step verdict (✅ / ❌ / ✅→❌) |
| **expected** | `expected` | `Cn [class]marker label` | empty — or the verdict for a no-evidence-row contract |
| **💭** | `💭` | an ALWAYS-collapsed `<details><summary>thinking</summary>…</details>`, one per model action, directly ABOVE it (`💭 (empty)` when the model emitted none) | always empty |
| **actual** | `actual` | one transcript event (`🔧 call` · `📥 result` · `🤖 reply` · `👤 nudge` · `🧩 micro-context ← user turn:` / `🧩 micro-context →`) | the check verdict on the anchor row; `⚠ recovery event` on a nudge; else empty |
| **baseline** | `baseline` | the prior run's anchor event (diff mode only) | the prior verdict, tagged `*(prior run)*` |
| **note** | `note` | free text, always last | always empty |

**Check identity + class.** Each check renders `Cn [class]marker label` on its `expected` row.
`Cn` is `C1, C2, …` in scorer order; a framework guard is `Gn`. `[class]` is an authoring tag —
`[spine]` (call-spine) · `[reply]` (reply-content) · `[state]` (durable state) · `[proc]`
(procedure) · `[guard]` (framework-injected). `marker` is `⚖` (a **scored** check, counts toward
the score) or `ℹ` (an **advisory** check — renders, never scores); an n/a check carries neither.

**Verdict cell.** `mark [Cn] [— rationale] [· cause]`. The marks:

| mark | meaning |
|---|---|
| `✅` | check passed |
| `❌` | check failed (carries its observed-vs-expected `rationale` + the sample's `cause`) |
| `✅→❌ **REGRESSED**` | failed here, fully green in the baseline run — a flip (diff mode) |
| `❌→✅ **FIXED**` | passed here, failing in the baseline run (diff mode) |
| `➖ n/a` | the check's branch didn't run this sample — out of the graded denominator |
| `⚠ recovery event` | on a nudge row: the loop refused/recovered a call (flags a passing sample `fragile`) |

**Verdict placement (the anchor rule).** A check anchored to a transcript event renders its
`expected` row atop that event's step and its verdict on that event's `actual` row. A check with
**no anchor row** — a whole-run property, or a *missing* expected action that never happened —
falls to the **run-close** table (`| run-close | whole-conversation contracts | k/n |`), where its
verdict sits on its own `expected` row (these have no evidence row of their own). This is the
deterministic realization of "run-close = checks with no anchor row."

## Per-sample banner + folding

Each sample opens with a banner naming its stats before you read a row:

```
<verdict> · <k/n> (<score>) · [fragile ·] [cause ·] <duration>s · <calls> calls
```

A clean pass carries no cause; a passed-but-shaky sample — one that reached its result only after a
**recovery event** (a rejected/refused tool call, OR a user-turn recovery nudge — the continue and
parse-failure nudges the render marks `⚠ recovery event`) — carries `fragile`; a **harness-timeout**
sample (no completed turn) omits `k/n` (the scorer never ran) and renders an honest placeholder body
instead of a table — so the report's sample count always matches N (visible degradation).

**Uniform sample-level collapse — the one and only rendering (#1753/#1759).** EVERY sample block
folds whole — the entire block inside a `<details>` whose `<summary>` is `sample N — <banner>` —
regardless of verdict (passing, failed, fragile, regressed, harness-timeout). It is **collapsed by
default, and its full body is always one click away**: "default collapsed" never means the body is
dropped. There is **no compact / banner-only form and no `--full` flag** — the per-case `.md` and
the assembled comment render each sample identically, byte-for-byte. The report's visible skeleton
is the run header → per-case heading + RESULT/gate lines → **sample banner rows**; everything below
a banner is one click deep. This supersedes the old density-follows-failure split (a clean pass
folded, a failure rendered unfolded); the assembler re-normalizes even a re-assembled prior run
(whose failures may be in the pre-#1753 unfolded `#### ` form) to the uniform fold.

## System prompts (per context) — one collapsed row each (#1759)

Every rendered sample carries, **directly under its banner and inside the fold**, one always-
collapsed `<details>` row per DISTINCT system prompt among that sample's promptlog calls — the main
agent's (`chat` / `collector`) and each micro-context flavour's (`browse-extract`,
`state-classifier`). The summary names the context + size — `system prompt — <agent> (<n> chars)` —
and the verbatim prompt sits inside. Identical prompts within a sample dedupe by text, so a repeated
main-loop prompt renders once. Source: the persisted promptlog messages (`role: system`).

Motivation: a micro-context's `🧩 micro-context ← user turn:` row is that context's **USER** turn,
not its system prompt — and the user mistook one for the other. When the surface under test IS a
micro-context, its system prompt is half the contract, so each distinct context gets its own visible
row. The rows are always present in the per-case `.md` and the assembled comment (there is no
compact form to drop them).

## Micro-context (🧩) — an official actor

A browse call carrying an `extract` micro-instruction spawns a single-shot extraction sub-model
(`browse-extract`). Its exchange renders inline, in ledger order, as two `actual` rows — the
instruction + page content INTO the sub-model as its scoped USER turn (`🧩 micro-context ← user
turn: …`, #1759 — the explicit role label, so it is never mistaken for the sub-model's system
prompt, which has its own [system-prompt row](#system-prompts-per-context--one-collapsed-row-each-1759))
and its extracted value OUT (`🧩 micro-context → EXTRACTED: …`) — with the sub-model's own
`💭 (micro-context)` above the OUT row. A multi-page `extract` browse renders one pair per page. The
main-loop context never sees the page body; only the typed value returns — the report is the one
place that exchange is visible.

## Run header

The comment opens with the run header (no per-sample transcript above it):

- **identity** — `**<run-id>** · commit \`<sha>\` [(dirty)] · <model> · N=<n> · **lever:** <lever>`.
  The **lever** is required (the run's hypothesis; an unlabelled run can't attribute a score shift).
- **RESULT** — one line: `mean · all-pass · pathology-excluded · causes — behavioral B · pathology P
  · harness H · families: <fam> <mean> [(k cases)] · … · <calls> calls · <s>s · <in>K in / <out>K out`.
  *mean* is the partial-credit mean the case gates on; *all-pass* the strict count of perfect
  samples; *pathology-excluded* the honest mean over every non-pathology sample; the *families*
  rollup names each family's mean (a case count only when a family spans more than one case).
- **gate** — one line per gated case: `**gate:** [<case>: ]⚖ <threshold> on <metric> → **PASS/FAIL**
  (<value>)`, where `<metric>` is `mean` or `pathology-excluded` (the honest-threshold opt-in, #1698).
  A report-only case (`min_pass_rate=None`) has no gate line.
- **flips** (diff mode) — `flips: <label> ✅→❌ (s1, s3) · …`, one entry per check that was fully
  green in the baseline but failed a sample here. This is the one cross-sample join the transcript
  flow can't give you; it joins on `(case_id, label)`. The assembler resolves the baseline from the
  run's **durable manifest reference** (`RunManifest.baseline`, recorded from `EVAL_BASELINE` at eval
  time), so the index survives to assemble time even when `make assemble` carries no `EVAL_BASELINE`
  — the same durable state the per-row REGRESSED badges were baked from, so header and badges agree
  (#1752). An explicit `EVAL_BASELINE` at assemble time overrides it (an ad-hoc re-diff).

Then one section per case — a `### \`<case_id>\` — <family>` heading **only when the run spans
multiple cases** — above that case's per-sample blocks. A single-case run needs no divider.

## Diff mode (when a baseline is set)

Same grammar plus the `baseline` row (the prior run's anchor event, its cell the prior verdict) and
the flip badges (`✅→❌ REGRESSED` / `❌→✅ FIXED`) in place of the plain glyph; the step header shows
the step-level flip, and the run header gains the `flips:` index. The baseline is set via
`EVAL_BASELINE` at eval time (baking the per-row badges into the transcripts) and **recorded in the
manifest** so the flips index re-derives at assemble time from that durable reference, not the live
env (#1752). Off-diff (no baseline, or a first run) there are no baseline rows, no flip badges, and
no flips line — no error.

## Deterministic cell hygiene

- **Escaping.** Every cell escapes `|` (→ `\|`) and renders newlines as `<br>`, so a tool call or a
  multi-line result stays inside its cell.
- **Truncation (#1759).** An `actual` cell over ~500 chars collapses into a **single** `<details>` —
  its first line + `… (<n> chars)` in the `<summary>`, the full escaped text inside, **one copy, no
  visible head** (consistent with everything-defaults-collapsed; the old head + nested-full form
  duplicated the head on expand and read absurd just past the threshold). A browse page body renders
  as its fetch handle + first line. One rule, applied by the renderer — never ad-hoc.

## Footer

The n≤1 pointer from the comment back to the raw evidence: the local `<report dir>` where every
sample's full transcript, per-sample DB, and raw artifacts live (the same folded bodies the comment
carries — the `.md` and the comment are one rendering), and the `make assemble` re-render line.

```
_artifacts (local, never committed): `<report dir>` · per-sample DBs beside them · re-render: `EVAL_REPORT_DIR=<report dir> make assemble`_
```

## What gets committed

**Nothing.** Run artifacts are **never committed to the repo** — baselines included. The durable
record of every run is its **assembled report, posted as a PR comment** (the iteration protocol,
#1711). ALL raw artifacts — `manifest.json`, `results.jsonl`, the per-case `<case_id>.md`
transcripts, the per-sample `<case>-<n>.db` files, and `dirty.diff` — live **locally on the eval
host**, and **`EVAL_BASELINE` diffs against those local paths**. The report footer points at that
local directory for audit. There is no committed-baseline tier.

**Local artifact home = the primary checkout's `data/eval-artifacts/` (#1734).** The `data/` bind
mount is relative to the compose-file directory, so a `make eval` run from a *worktree* would
otherwise write its artifacts under that worktree's `data/` — where they die when the worktree is
swept post-merge. Instead, `make eval` / `make assemble` resolve the primary checkout host-side
(from the shared git common dir, identical from every worktree) and bind-mount its
`data/eval-artifacts` at `/penny/eval-artifacts`. A report run (one that declares `EVAL_LEVER`)
with no explicit `EVAL_REPORT_DIR` defaults to a run-stamped `/penny/eval-artifacts/run-<stamp>` —
i.e. `<primary-checkout>/data/eval-artifacts/run-<stamp>` on the host — so artifacts **survive the
worktree that produced them being removed**, and `EVAL_BASELINE` can point a later run at a prior
run's durable path. An explicit `EVAL_REPORT_DIR` is always honored (point it under
`/penny/eval-artifacts` to keep it durable).

## Check-label stability (an authoring note)

The diff joins on `(case_id, label)`, so **renaming a check silently breaks its regression
continuity** — the flip/REGRESSED machinery can no longer match it against the baseline. Relabeling
a check is therefore a recorded scorer-semantics change, not a cosmetic edit.

## Worked example

One complete run comment, rendered by the assembler — a chat-browse case at N=3 (a clean pass, plus a
harness-timeout sample the format makes visible). Entirely synthetic, shown in a fenced block so the
tables and `<details>` read as source. This is the **one and only** rendering — every sample folds
whole under its banner, collapsed by default with its full body a click away, byte-identical in the
per-case `.md` and this comment (there is no compact / banner-only form). Sample 1 opens with its
two distinct system-prompt rows (the `chat` main agent + the `browse-extract` micro-context, #1759).

Sample 2 (a second clean pass) folds the same way and is omitted here. The run reads top-down: the
gate line says the lever did **not** clear the bar (the timeout sample dragged the mean under 0.75),
and the folded F2 placeholder makes the timeout *visible* — its per-sample DB is one local hop away
for the full parse-failure trace, per the footer. Every sample — clean pass, failure, timeout —
folds whole under its banner: collapsed by default, its full body always one click away.

## Decided ambiguities (resolved here)

Points the reference grammar left open, decided for this implementation:

1. **Unanchored checks go to run-close** (not into a step) — the deterministic anchor rule. A
   check whose expected action never happened has no evidence row, so it renders in run-close.
2. **The `families:` rollup omits the case count for a single-case family** (`browse-answer 0.67`)
   and shows it only when a family spans more than one case (`recall 1.00 (2 cases)`).
3. **A per-case heading renders only in a multi-case run** — a single-case run's samples follow the
   run header directly.
4. **`FIXED` flips are not computed by the extractor** (the baseline record carries "was fully
   green", not "was fully red"); the renderer supports the badge, but the flips index surfaces
   **regressions** only.
5. **Thinking renders for every model action** (not only failed turns, superseding the earlier
   capture) — an empty thought before a degenerate act is itself signal (`💭 (empty)`).
