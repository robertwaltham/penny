"""Tests for SendMessageTool — content/availability gates + enqueue.

The tool no longer delivers directly: it enqueues into ``db.send_queue`` and
the ``SendQueueDrainer`` delivers later (see ``test_send_queue_drainer.py``),
so a cooldown delays a message rather than dropping it.  Three gates run before
the enqueue:

1. Refusal content ("I'm sorry, I can't...") — not a real reply, refuse.
2. Truncation (``…``/``...`` tail) — ``success=False`` so the loop retries.
3. ``users.is_muted(recipient)`` — refuse with a string that says to call ``done``.

A clean send is appended to the queue and returns the literal ``"Message sent."``
(``mutated=True``) — the successful handoff the collector prompts gate on.
