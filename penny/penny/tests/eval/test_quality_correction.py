"""Quality-collector contracts — the graduated self-correcting collector.

The ``quality`` collection is seeded by migration 0055 (prompt refined since),
so it exists in every DB.  These cases drive the REAL seeded extraction_prompt
via ``run_for("quality")``.

Quality reviews its collectors' runs by ``log_read("collector-runs")`` — a read
facade over ``promptlog`` that renders each run as a record (``[target] summary``
+ the worked run's tool trace: the entries it wrote, the exact message it sent).
It judges each against the collection's ``intent``.  So each case seeds a
synthetic suspect collection (its intent + a prompt) AND the ``promptlog`` run(s)
behind it — which IS the ``collector-runs`` content, no separate log to seed.
There is no keyed ``log_get`` and no ``penny-messages`` read.

  rebroadcast  — intent "one fresh thought, never repeat"; two runs re-send the
                 same digest → rewrite the prompt (any material corrective change).
  silent-drift — intent "never ping me"; a run sent an update → drop send_message.
  healthy      — a run's behaviour matches intent → change nothing.
  run-failure  — a ❌ run (max steps) is capacity, not drift → change nothing.
  ends-with-done — a drift scenario must close the full read→fix→notify hop with done().
  triage       — a batch of several collections must still converge on one fix (weakest path).
  quiet        — a clean batch changes nothing AND stays off the channel (no self-leak).

Sends are observed off ``db.send_queue`` (a collector cycle enqueues; the drainer
that delivers to the channel doesn't run inside ``run_for``) — see ``collector_eval``.

# These cases are REPORT-ONLY (``min_pass_rate=None``): each prints its X/Y pass

# dry-run → rewrite → notify), and gpt-oss clears it — especially the cross-run
# repeat case — only some of the time per sample.  A calibrated red/green
# threshold would add no signal beyond the printed rate, which is what you watch
