"""Chat-response contracts — the chat agent's day-to-day replies (the #1
user-facing prompt type), driven against the REAL model and scored on
PERSISTED state + the reply text.

The collection-lifecycle suite already covers the chat agent *authoring*
collections; this covers the other branch — *responding*.  Every Penny reply is
either answered from system context (recall routed into the prompt) or reached
for the web (a ``browse`` call it then reasons over), so the cases span:

  chitchat       — casual turn → coherent reply, no spurious tool/collection.
  recall-answer  — a memory question → answered from the routed-in collection.
  browse-answer  — a factual question → browse → extract the fact → answer.
  browse-multihop— the fact lives one link deep → chain a second browse to it.

Browse cases inject query-aware canned pages (``browse=`` on chat_eval) so we
score the model's *subsequent* reasoning, not merely that it called browse.
Scoring is on BEHAVIOUR (tool called, fact surfaced, nothing spurious created),
never on exact wording — the model is stochastic.
