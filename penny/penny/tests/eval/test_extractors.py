"""Core extraction-collector contracts — the background collectors that make up
the bulk of production runs, driven against the REAL model via ``run_for`` on
their CANONICAL migration-seeded extraction prompts.

These collections (``likes``, ``dislikes``, ``knowledge``, ``unnotified-thoughts``,
``notified-thoughts``) already exist with their prompts in a fresh eval DB
(migrations 0027/0031/0033), so each case only seeds the collector's INPUT — the
``user-messages`` / ``browse-results`` logs, or prior thought entries — and
checks the entry-level outcome on the bound collection (diffing before/after).

Every collector is one of two shapes, both covered here:

  read memory/log → write          likes / dislikes / knowledge / notify
  browse → extract → write/notify   research-watcher / inner-monologue

Browse-driven cases inject query-aware canned pages (``browse=``) so the
*subsequent* call (the write, the send) is what gets scored.  Sends are read off
``db.send_queue`` (a cycle enqueues; the drainer doesn't run inside ``run_for``).
