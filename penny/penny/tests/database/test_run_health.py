"""Run-health classification — the shared signal Penny's quality collector and
the addon's prompts tab both read.

``classify_run`` and ``render_run_record`` are pure functions of a run's
``PromptLog`` rows, so these build rows directly (no DB) and assert the four
failure modes are flagged structurally: a bail (no work done), an incomplete run
(hit the step ceiling), a tool-failure spiral, and a half-formed send.  A healthy
worked run and a healthy quiet read carry no flags.
