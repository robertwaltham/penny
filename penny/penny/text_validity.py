"""Content-validity primitives — pure text predicates, no DB / no model.

The one home for "is this text usable?" rules, kept dependency-light (only ``re``
+ ``PennyConstants``) so every layer can import it without dragging in the
database or agent packages.  Two callers that must agree share these:

  * the memory write path (``Collection.write`` / the ``exists`` probe) rejects
    degenerate corpus content via :func:`degenerate_reason`;
  * the ``send_message`` tool's ``args_model`` validator AND the run-health
    classifier's ``⚠ HALF-FORMED SEND`` flag both gate on
    :func:`half_formed_send_reason` — one definition for what Penny refuses to
    send and what she flags as a regression.

Living here (rather than inside ``database/memory/_similarity``) is what lets
``tools/models.py`` import :func:`half_formed_send_reason` without triggering the
``penny.database`` package import (which would close an import cycle back through
``penny.agents``).  The ``database.memory`` package re-exports these names from
here, so its public import surface is unchanged.
