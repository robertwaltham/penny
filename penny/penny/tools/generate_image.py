"""GenerateImageTool — model-driven image generation via the Ollama image model.

A thin wrapper over the same ``OllamaImageClient`` the retired ``/draw`` command
used.  Registered on the chat surface only when an image model is configured
(mirroring ``/draw``'s conditionality).

The generated image is delivered **deterministically** to its own reply, not
fuzzy-matched against the media table: the tool stores it in the ``media`` table
and stamps that row's id onto its ``ToolResult.media_id``.  The loop threads the
id onto ``ControllerResponse.generated_media_ids`` and the channel fetches
exactly that row at egress (see the image side-channel design in
``penny/CLAUDE.md``), so a just-drawn image always lands on the reply that
describes it — never a stale, embedding-nearest one.  The row is still stored
with an embedding of the description, so the drawn image joins the
nearest-image pool (``MediaStore.select_image``) for *future* replies.  The
tool returns a text result naming what it drew so the model's final reply
honestly describes the image the user is about to receive.
