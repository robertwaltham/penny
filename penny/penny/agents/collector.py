"""Collector — single dispatcher agent for per-collection extraction.

One ``Collector`` instance runs in the background.  Each cycle it picks
the most-overdue ready collection from ``memory`` (where
``extraction_prompt IS NOT NULL`` and
``now - last_collected_at >= collector_interval_seconds``), binds itself
to that target, runs the agent loop with the target's extraction prompt
as instructions and a tool surface scoped to writes against that
collection only, then stamps ``last_collected_at = now``.

Dispatcher pattern (vs. one stateful agent per collection):
  - No agent registry to keep in sync with the DB; reading the DB each
    cycle IS the source of truth.
  - Hot-add for free — chat creates a new collection mid-session, the
    next dispatcher tick picks it up.
  - Per-collection cadence respected naturally via the readiness check.
  - Log read cursors partition per collection: ``get_tools`` keys the
    memory tools on the bound collection name (``_memory_scope()``), not
    the constant ``"collector"`` identity.  Keying on the identity would
    collapse every collection that reads the same log (e.g. the many that
    read ``user-messages``) onto one shared cursor — whichever ran first
    would consume the new entries and starve the rest.
