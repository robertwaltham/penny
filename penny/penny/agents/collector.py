"""Collector — single dispatcher agent for per-collection extraction.

One ``Collector`` instance runs in the background.  Each cycle it picks
the most-overdue ready collection from ``memory`` (where
``extraction_prompt IS NOT NULL`` and
``now - last_collected_at >= collector_interval_seconds``), binds itself
to that target, runs the agent loop with the target's extraction prompt
as instructions and a tool surface scoped to writes against that
collection only, then stamps ``last_collected_at = now``.

Readiness has a second gate beyond the interval: a *log-driven* collection
(one that reads a log via ``log_read``, leaving a read cursor) is skipped
without entering the model whenever every one of its live input logs is
caught up — ``head <= last_read_at``.  The cursors a collection already
holds are its declared inputs, so no spec is needed; a cursor whose log the
prompt no longer names is pruned so it can't keep gating.  This replaces the
auto-throttle for these collections: instead of widening the interval after
idle cycles (which stalls catch-up when the log starts moving again), the
gate runs the collection exactly when — and only when — its inputs advance.
Generative / collection-driven collections (no log cursor) keep the
interval + auto-throttle fallback.

Dispatcher pattern (vs. one stateful agent per collection):
  - No agent registry to keep in sync with the DB; reading the DB each
    cycle IS the source of truth.
  - Hot-add for free — chat creates a new collection mid-session, the
    next dispatcher tick picks it up.
  - Per-collection cadence respected naturally via the readiness check.
  - Log read cursors partition per collection: ``get_tools`` keys the
    memory tools on the bound collection name (``_memory_scope()``), not
    the constant ``"collector"`` identity.  Keying on the identity would
    collapse every collection that reads the same log (e.g. the many that
    read ``user-messages``) onto one shared cursor — whichever ran first
    would consume the new entries and starve the rest.
